# backend instructions 
# 1. send user response to LLM and return LLM answer to user
# 2. alter Mr. Krabs' crabiness level in the LLM responses (ðŸ“Œfigure out how to rep that in LLM params)
#     - default crabiness level 5 
#     - low crabiness level is like he's talking to he's daughter Pearl = 1
#     - high crabiness level is as if you send all his money = 10
# 3. customize which LLM model you'd like to use and how to connect with the model
#     - gemini, GPT, transformer
